EXPERIENCE

Senior Machine Learning Scientist
Synaptica AI, Remote
April 2020 – Present

    Designed deep learning pipelines in PyTorch and Scikit-learn for financial anomaly detection.

    Trained and deployed multiple models on AWS SageMaker and EC2.

    Built RESTful prediction APIs using FastAPI; basic Flask knowledge used for MVP prototypes.

    Maintained experiment tracking with MLflow and model versioning using DVC.

Machine Learning Research Intern
Google Research, Mountain View, CA
Summer 2018

    Published 2 peer-reviewed papers on sequence labeling tasks using Transformer architectures.

    Used Google Cloud ML pipelines for distributed training and model serving.

PROJECTS

ModelAudit | Research Toolkit
github.com/priyar-ai/modelaudit

    Python toolkit for debugging black-box ML models with SHAP, LIME, and counterfactuals.

    Deployed demo version using Streamlit and Docker; future migration to Flask API planned.

BioLabel | Academic Collaboration

    Built an NLP model using BERT to auto-annotate biomedical abstracts.

    Deployed FastAPI wrapper for internal use; not production-focused.
